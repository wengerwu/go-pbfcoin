If you'd like to contribute to go-pbfcoin please fork, fix, commit and
send a pull request. Commits who do not comply with the coding standards
are ignored (use gofmt!). If you send pull requests make absolute sure that you
commit on the `develop` branch and that you do not merge to master.
Commits that are directly based on master are simply ignored.

See [Developers' Guide](https://github.com/pbfcoin/go-pbfcoin/wiki/Developers'-Guide)
for more details on configuring your environment, testing, and
dependency management.
